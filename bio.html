<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
I live in San Diego. <br> <br>
You can see my publications on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=1&user=8nbRXMoAAAAJ">google scholar profile</a>. <br> <br>
I have a few projects on Github that may be useful: <br>
<br>
x  <a href="https://github.com/hunterakins/pykrak">pykrak</a> - a Python code for numerically solving the acoustic wave equation in a cylindrically symmetric layered fluid waveguide. 
<br>
x  <a href="https://github.com/hunterakins/pyat">pyat</a> - a Python interface for the <a href="http://oalib.hlsresearch.com/AcousticsToolbox/">Acoustics Toolbox</a>.
<br>
x  <a href="https://github.com/hunterakins/samplers">samplers</a> - Python implementations of a number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Includes a parallel tempering sampler with adaptive proposal covariance matrix estimation, numba-ized affine invariant sampler with and without parallel tempering, and reverse jump sampler with parallel tempering for polynomial regression as well as a change-point problem.

I am working on a tutorial for trans-dimensional MCMC. You can see a draft of it <a href="trans_d.pdf">here</a>.
