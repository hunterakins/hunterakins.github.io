<h1>
Testing if the Red Pitaya does anti-aliasing.
</h1>
<h2>
Test 1: Sanity check.
</h2>
<p>
<br>
Sample at 15.258 kS/s.
<br>
Use the output to generate a 15.258 kHz signal.
<br>
My acquired signal should be DC.
<br>
Result: It seems to vary randomly between a 5 discrete levels. With the 14 bit ADC representing -1V to 1V, each level represents 2V/2^14 = 122uV. 
<br>
Interestingly, you would expect it to be DC, but with its value fixed by the phase of the incoming signal. Thus, different acquisitions would have different DC values.
<br>
However, I plotted it for a few different acquisitions and it was roughly the same (about 0) every time. Seems to suggest some filtering may be happening.

<h2>
Test 2: Second sanity check. 
</h2>
<p>
Sample at 15.258kS/s.
<br>
Use the output channel to generate a 1kHz wave.
<br>
Snag first .01 seconds. With period of 1ms, I should see 10 periods.
<br>
Result: Looks pretty good.

<h2>
Test 3: Aliasing
</h2>
<p>
Sample at 15.258kS/s.
<br>
Use the output channel to generate a 16kHz wave.
<br>
Expected result if I plot the first .01 seconds of time domain data (background is the actual signal):

Actual result:

As you can see, the aliased signal is clearly there, but attentuated by a factor of 200.
Seems like the Red Pitaya built-in acquisition program does some filtering.
